Increasing popularity of blockchain enabled systems has 
also brought about some concerns due to its transparent 
ledger system. 
Because of this many competiting companies are not able 
to use blockchain to secure their precious assets. 
In order to solve this we present a solution using an open 
source blockchain namely HyperLedger Fabric
Blockchain approach to cyber security vulnerabilities
We make use of HyperLedger fabric to develop a secure 
private blockchain network between two organizations. By 
this we are creating a seperate channel for these 
organizations to perform secure transactions of assets 
between them.
